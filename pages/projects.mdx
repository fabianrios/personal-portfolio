## Colombian internal conflict timeline
2022

This work is a geographical and time based explorer of different tagged events between more than 50 years of Colombian conflict. it was born as a proposed 
UI to navigate the internal truth commission database. information can be explore ranging from different dates, event category, parties involved and geographic locations.

every item/event is expandable so further information could be seen on a modal with associated tags and possible "involved groups"

Can we perceive a socio-economical or spacial segregation
through a social media photo culture?

With digital based media spaces we have the unique ability to
trace back this behaviours and analyse them in a quantitative
way all the actions previously (or Real time) perform to be able to research human behaviour across different platforms for
example: Twitter conversations, mobility around the cities, Instagram pics or purchasing patterns.

The end product generated is a data visualisation website analysing #foodie pics patterns crossed with socio-economical data on major social media sharing cities around the globe

## Soar race
2016

![soarrace](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fabianrios/proyectos/imagens/000/000/024/large/bg.png?1500023874)

an game based in the ethical dilema of having to program selfdriving cars to chose over people lifes in case of real accidents (trolley problem) it gets the list of people from your iPhone contact list an make you choose between them while driving a car through the highway.

*“Save the one in the car. If all you know for sure is that one death can be prevented, then that’s your first priority.”*  [link Accessed 15.07.17](http://fortune.com/2016/10/15/mercedes-self-driving-car-ethics)

that was part of the comments made by Mercedes-Benz executive Christoph von Hugo in and interview made by Car and Driver when ask about how the company he represents will take care of the ethical problem of an accident in the road in which the car will have to prioritise between different human lives, usually known as the trolley problem with the new self driving technology just around the corner.

![soarrace](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fabianrios/proyectos/theimages/000/000/024/large/appstore.png?1500023876)

If we take this previous experience and transport it as a metaphor of how it will look like the future of automated self driving car the market again will dictate under what shape their are going to play the tone for ethical dilemmas and even when is going to be possible to reprogram the car to what ever more persons feels comfortable under their own moral ground in the decisions taking, this time you can more likely be facing decades of Jail if you set your car to save you, or to save a specific group over another, call it pregnant mothers, children, woman in general, older people etc... or maybe if everyone is doing then it will be an elephant in the justice system and they will have to adapt as well. We definitely need the time and the will to think and take a stand as consumers and as a society to have this technology implemented according to our ethical cohesion. 


## Pump.io (let's make the breast pump not suck, MIT)
2014

![pumpio](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fabianrios/proyectos/imagens/000/000/013/large/pumpm_it.jpg?1452647249)

The event’s goal in this [MIT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackthebreastpump/) **hackathon** was to give the breast pump a much needed makeover—making it more efficient, more affordable and more comfortable for all moms and parties involved.

![pumpio](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fabianrios/proyectos/theimages/000/000/013/large/pump.jpg?1452647250)
![pumpio](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fabianrios/proyectos/otherimages/000/000/013/large/pump_hack.jpg?1452647252)

Our team made Pump.io a mobile based app that could interact with the breast pump technical capabilities as well as gathering data in order to constantly monitor the mom behavior and provide feedback over her needs, we thought possible to connect a network of proffesionals over the app with the available information making possible for mom's to ask questions and responses directly from professionals in the area.

PD: we won the third prize thanks to [Naia Health](http://naiahealth.com/) and we were really happy about it.
