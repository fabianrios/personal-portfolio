# Onomationary - Support Information

![onomationary](/images/onomato.jpg)

## Overview

Onomationary is a multilingual educational tool that teaches how different sounds are represented across cultures and languages. The app features onomatopoeia (sound words) from animals, objects, and actions in multiple languages, helping users discover the fascinating differences in how we interpret and express sounds around the world.

## What is Onomatopoeia?

Onomatopoeia refers to words that phonetically imitate the sound they represent. While we might think sounds are universal, different cultures hear and express them quite differently. For example, a dog's bark is "woof" in English, "guau" in Spanish, "wuff" in German, and "wan wan" in Japanese.

## Supported Languages

The app currently supports six languages:
- **English** (English)
