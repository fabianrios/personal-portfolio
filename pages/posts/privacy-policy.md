# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** June 27, 2024

**Applies to:**

* **Personal website:** [https://fabianrios.co](https://fabianrios.co)
* **iOS App 1:** Trolley Game
* **iOS App 2:** Onomationary
* Collectively, these are referred to as the “Services.”


## Summary

We do **not** collect, track, store, share, sell, or otherwise process any personal data from users of the Services. We do not use analytics, advertising technologies, SDKs, or profiling tools.


## Data We Do Not Collect

We do not collect any of the following from you:

* Personal identifiers (e.g., name, email, address, phone number)
* Device or app identifiers
* Usage data or diagnostics
* Location data (precise or coarse)
* Contacts, calendars, photos, videos, or other media
* Health, fitness, financial, or payment information
* Messages, audio, or other user-generated content
* Cookies or similar tracking technologies (for the website)

Because we do not collect data, we do not sell, rent, share, or disclose any personal data to third parties.


## Third‑Party Services

The Services do **not** integrate any third‑party analytics, advertising networks, or data collection SDKs. If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy before enabling such services.

---

## Children’s Privacy

The Services are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from anyone, including children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided personal data through the Services, please contact us so we can address it; however, the Services are designed not to collect any such data.

---

## International Transfers

No personal data is collected or processed by us; therefore, no international data transfers occur.

---

## Data Retention & Deletion

We do not collect or retain personal data. As such, there is no personal data to delete. If you contact us directly (e.g., by email), any information you voluntarily provide will be used solely to respond to your inquiry and then deleted unless we are legally required to retain it.

---

## Your Rights

Because we do not collect personal data via the Services, typical data subject rights (access, correction, deletion, portability, objection, restriction) are generally not applicable. If you contact us and provide personal data, you may exercise applicable rights by contacting us at the email below.

## Changes to This Policy

If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated version at this URL and revise the **Effective date** above. If we ever plan to collect data in the future, we will update this Policy before doing so.

## Platform‑Specific Notices

* **Apple App Store (iOS Apps):** We declare “Data Not Collected” in App Privacy on App Store Connect. If functionality ever changes to collect data, we will update both App Privacy details and this Privacy Policy in advance.
* **Website:** We do not set cookies, use analytics, or embed third‑party trackers. If you later enable any hosting logs, analytics, or embeds that collect data, you must update this Policy to reflect that.
