Hey, I'm a Media Artist and Senior Web Developer. I graduated as a Media Artist and I got involved in web development from design to coding and crafting elegant user center websites and applications for about <KidsYears year="'01-01-2013'" /> years now.

I live with my beautiful wife [Cristina](https://www.instagram.com/crisescobarderios/), my children Samuel (<KidsYears year="'11-17-2013'" /> years) - Gabriel (<KidsYears year="'06-09-2015'" /> years), Simon (<KidsYears year="'10-17-2019'" />  years) and my dog Jet in Düsseldorf, Germany
