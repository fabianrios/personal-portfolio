## Trolley Game - Support Information

![trolley](/images/trolley.jpg)

## Overview

Trolley Game is an interactive thought experiment app that presents ethical dilemmas through the classic "trolley problem" scenario. Players must make quick moral decisions under pressure using their own contact list, exploring themes of utilitarian ethics, moral responsibility, and decision-making.

## What is the Trolley Problem?

The trolley problem is a famous ethical thought experiment first introduced by philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967. It presents a moral dilemma where you must decide whether to redirect a runaway trolley to save multiple lives at the cost of one life, or allow events to proceed naturally.

## How to Play

### Game Mechanics
- **The Scenario**: A runaway trolley is heading toward multiple people on the main track
- **Your Choice**: Pull the lever to redirect the trolley to a side track with one person, or do nothing
- **Time Pressure**: You have only 3 seconds to make your decision
- **Control**: Tap, swipe down, or swipe up on the red lever to change the track

### Controls
- **Tap the Red Lever**: Toggle the switch position
- **Swipe Down**: Pull the lever (redirect trolley to side track)
- **Swipe Up**: Push lever back (trolley continues straight)
- **No Action**: Trolley continues on main track

### Visual Elements
- **Track Switch**: Shows current path with color-coded indicator
    - Green: Trolley goes straight (multiple casualties)
    - Red: Trolley diverts left (single casualty)
- **Countdown Timer**: 3-second visual countdown before trolley proceeds
- **Realistic Environment**: Detailed railway setting with grass, ballast, and metal tracks

## Understanding Your Choices

### Option 1: Do Nothing (Don't Pull Lever)
- Trolley continues straight
- Multiple people on the main track are affected
- You didn't actively cause harm, but allowed it to happen

### Option 2: Pull the Lever
- Trolley diverts to side track
- One person on the side track is affected
- You actively chose to redirect harm to save more lives

## Technical Features

### Realistic Physics
- Smooth trolley movement with realistic turning
- Physics-based lever mechanics
- Authentic railway environment rendering

### Interactive Elements
- Touch-responsive lever with multiple interaction methods
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Sound effects for mechanical operations

### Educational Purpose
This app is designed to help users explore ethical decision-making through:
- Time pressure scenarios
- Consequence visualization
- Moral reasoning exercises

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this game suitable for all ages?
The app deals with mature philosophical themes involving life-and-death decisions. While presented in an abstract, educational context, parental guidance is recommended for younger users.

### Why is there a time limit?
The time pressure simulates real-world emergency scenarios where quick moral decisions must be made, adding psychological realism to the philosophical exercise.

### Can I replay scenarios?
Yes, each round presents a new scenario with different people, allowing you to explore various decision-making approaches.

### What happens to my choices?
Your decisions are recorded to help you reflect on your moral reasoning patterns and decision-making tendencies under pressure.

## Troubleshooting

### Lever Not Responding
- Ensure you're touching the red handle area
- Try different interaction methods (tap, swipe)
- Check that the countdown hasn't expired

### App Performance Issues
- Restart the app if animations become choppy
- Ensure adequate device storage
- Close other apps running in background

### Visual Glitches
- Update to the latest app version
- Restart your device if problems persist

## Educational Context

This app is intended as an educational tool for:
- Philosophy students studying ethics
